# User Experience (UX)

The user experience is designed to be as user friendly and intuitive as possible. Clear instructions and feedback messages are provided to the user and some colour has been added to text. This adds to the user experience withn the constraints of a console line web application.


## Design

The Design process for the hangman game started with a flow chart to map out the steps involved through out life cycle of the game.
